## Introduction
When the pandemic happened unexpectedly, the UK housing prices were soaring. Some said increasing housing prices could be the "cheap money" floated into the housing market, as governments printed money to tackle the public health crisis in the short term, whereas others said more demands than supplies for nice houses as many companies were implementing 'Working From Home' policies. The price behaviour interested me.

The real estate economy plays a vital role in a country. My father runs a real estate developing company. He told me how the real estate industry affects China economy. For example, the government would involve legal regulations and taxation, either they support it or disencourage it. More construction projects mean more job supplies. The upper stream in the industry would be manufacturers for building materials, construction companies, etc, whereas the down stream are marketing companies, sales companies etc. My initial intention was to see how housing markets can reveal economic growth, but the main focus of this project is data visualization regarding the UK housing market 12-year data analysis.
